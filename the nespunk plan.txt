FEATURES
turn system
- press button to go to next turn
- regulates other game processes (eg. fuel consumption)

random events
- chance to fire every turn
- minor events:
	- small effect to hope or discontent
	- give/take small amount of resources
- major events:
	- give resources/turn
	- significant effect to hope or discontent
	- give new pops

resources
- distributed around the city and in outposts
- initially city resources are enough, but later outposts are needed
- outpost deposits provide much more than city mines
	- incentivizes replacing city mines with other districts over time
- three types: coal, wood, iron
	- coal: needed to operate reactor
	- wood: needed to make new districts
	- iron: needed for specialty districts and outposts

population and opinion
- pop count
- hope and discontent
	- affected by different things
		- high heat keeps hope up - low heat reduces hope
		- high resources keeps discontent low - low resources increases discontent
		- insufficient housing space increases discontent
	- negative effects if hope < 25 or disc > 75
	- game ends if hope reaches 0 or disc reaches 100

paths
- in the early game (turn 5?) you MUST choose one
- faith: raises hope
	- building specialty districts (churches) increases hope
	- you get faith-specific responses to some events
- order: lowers discontent
	- building specialty districts (prisons) reduces discontent
	- you get order-specific responses to some events

weather
- number representing temperature
- lower temps lead to higher required reactor power or faster hope loss
- no effect on outposts

reactor
- requires coal
- provides heat to city
- can change heat levels
	- higher levels give more heat, but require more coal
- game ends if it ever goes out

city districts
- three types: mining, housing, specialty
	- mining: provides resources/turn, very cheap (requires wood)
	- housing: provides space for 100 pops, cheap (requires wood)
	- specialty: changes based on path (faith vs order), raising hope or lowering discontent (requires iron)

outposts
- provides resources/turn (much more than a city mine)
- require some resources (coal)/turn
- require 20 workers and XXX iron to form

ui
- displays info for item
- gives some button options for interaction (changes depending on item)

game
- survive 20 turns to win

TASKS (some of these are already done)
turn system
- [X] button to increment turn
- [X] turn counter
- [X] other nodes can sense and respond to turns

random events
- [X] can have different effects (on resources and on population)
- [ ] have special ui for interacting
- [X] responses can be modified (eg. from choosing faith or order path)

resources
- [ ] global resource counters for coal, wood, and iron independent of current scene
	- [ ] can be added to or removed from
	- [ ] represented on ui
- [ ] resource deposits placed in city (for mines) and in wasteland (for outposts)

population and opinion
- [ ] global population counter independent of current scene
	- [ ] represented on ui
- [ ] population capacity based on available housing space
	- [ ] population growth per turn
- [ ] global hope and discontent counters (as percentages) independent of current scene
	- [ ] can be added to or removed from
	- [ ] represented on ui

paths
- [ ] custom event for faith vs order path choice
- [ ] record of chosen path
	- [ ] chosen path unlocks special responses to some events
	- [ ] chosen path unlocks path-specific specialty district
- [ ] choosing a path enables you to build specialty districts

weather
- [ ] global temp counter independent of current scene
	- [ ] represented on ui
- [ ] temp can be raised or lowered
- [ ] temp starts at heat level 0 (or -1) and goes down on certain turns
	- [ ] temp removes from the heat level of districts, requiring the player to increase reactor power
	- [ ] can go down as low as -5 during the final few turns

reactor
- [ ] consumes coal per turn
	- [ ] higher power level = more coal consumed
- [X] has power level (1-5)
- [ ] power level provides heat to surrounding districts

city districts
- [X] have slots
- [ ] have heat level
	- [ ] hope changes based on avg. heat level/city pop (unaffected by outposts)
- [ ] can be built on empty slots
- [ ] can be changed on occupied slots
- mines
	- [ ] provide resources per turn
	- [ ] require workers
	- [ ] requires wood to build
- housing
	- [ ] provides housing space
	- [ ] requires wood to build
- specialty
	- [ ] unlocked once paths available
	- changes based on path
		- [ ] faith: adds hope / turn / district
		- [ ] order: reduces disc / turn / district
	- [ ] requires workers
	- [ ] requires iron to build

outposts
- [ ] can be built on empty deposits
	- [ ] toggleable map view to see deposits and outposts
- [ ] provide resources per turn (based on deposit type)
- [ ] requires workers
- [ ] requires iron to build

ui
- [X] can be navigated easily
- [X] can be closed and opened
- [ ] fixed to right side

game
- [ ] detects when turn 21 is reached and gives win screen
- [ ] otherwise gives lose screen
